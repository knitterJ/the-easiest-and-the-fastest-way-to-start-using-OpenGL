## What are OpenGL loading libraries? 

What's interesting, OpenGL is already preinstalled in your Windows, but it's still necesary to configure a loading library. Loading library is responsible for loading pointers to OpenGL functions at runtime. This way, you don't need to load OpenGL functions manually.

## GLAD configuration 

1) Go to [official Glad website](https://glad.dav1d.de/) and generate GLAD for the newest version of OpenGL (OpenGL 4.6 was released in 2017, so I assume that you don't need to download earlier version)
